# Animautomata

## Summary

An open-source, zero-dependency, fully-typed solution for creating high-quality loading animations that are lightweight and fit your brand identity, using the Canvas API.

## Features

- Fully-typed (source written in Typescript).
- Zero-dependency.
- Simple but deeply configurable API.
- Create and experiment using the [Animautomata Forge web GUI](https://animautomata.eracodes.net)
- Plug-and-play React components are available with [`animautomata-react`](https://github.com/era-epoch/animautomata-react).
- No image files => faster loading. The minified library size is ~28kb. For comparison [the first google image result for "loading animation gif"](https://i.sstatic.net/kOnzy.gif) is over 80kb.
- Use the abstract `Animautomata` parent class to create your own custom presets.
- Add, transform, and remove loading animations with one line of javascript.
